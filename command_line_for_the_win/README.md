### Step 3: I printed the current working direcory with "pwd" then navigated to the alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win folder with "cd"

### Step 4: I printed the current local working directory using "lpwd" and then listed the files using "lls" in other to confirm that it is the folder containing the screenshots.
